# Wesbite: Emma Frampton
This website was initially developed for my EDUC485: Multimedia Literacy class, a graduate and undergraduate level class about Multimedia and its objectives. However, I intend to develop and update this website throughout my degree program and software developing journey.


At the moment, I have little to no experience in front-end development and would love to challenge myself to develop those skills. I am going to multiple hackathons and computing conferences this year and having a creative and professional website will allow me to showcase my projects, interests, and accomplishments to fellow developers.
